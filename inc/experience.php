<h3>JUNIOR FULL-STACK WEB DEVELOPER @ N-WARE KFT.</h3>
<h4>From August through October, 2017</h4>
<p>I’ve participated in many projects, most of the time in one which is a web application for a football team. It enables coaches to log information about the players, and receive back statistics and suggestions about training or team compilation. We used C#, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, MySQL, MSSQL, and front-end web technologies like HTML, CSS, JS.</p>
